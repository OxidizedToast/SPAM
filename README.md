Stay Productive App Manager, a app to keep you productive. Written in 100% Rust.

## Idea for the creation
I personally always struggle with being productive. So I though a good way to keep me productive is by making a tool to send me reminders to keep working, or force me 
to code so I keep learning.

## Commands:
`-h` -> Displays the help screen\
`-v` -> Displays version of the project\
`-t` -> Toggles if daemon is on
